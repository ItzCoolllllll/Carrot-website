### Our Company
 
 When you clicked inside here, you should be very shocked or incredible.
 You may be wondering why do we have a **company**.
 Our alliance, in order words, our company is not in reality, however, a place for us to enteretain ourselves.
 
To know more, there are breif introductions about our 'company'.

**Breif introduction**

Our chairman, Carrot, accidentally wrote 'Talents Promoting Scheme' (人才推廣計畫) instead of 'Quality Migrant Admission Scheme' (優秀人才入境計畫) in a F1 Liberal Studies quiz.
Since he thought that his mistake was not only funny but also 'talented', so he had an idea: creating 'Taletns limited company' (人才推廣計畫有限公司).
Moreover. our team name in PUBG is 'Team Laboratory' (實驗室隊).
So, we 'established' 'LabXTalents' (實驗室嘅人才推廣計畫有限公司).
