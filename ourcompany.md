To know more, there are breif introductions about our 'company':

**Breif introduction**

Our chairman, Carrot, accidentally wrote 'Talents Promoting Scheme' (人才推廣計畫) instead of 'Quality Migrant Admission Scheme' (優秀人才入境計畫) in a F1 Liberal Studies quiz.

Since he thought that his mistake was not only funny but also 'talented', so he had an idea: creating 'Taletns limited company' (人才推廣計畫有限公司).

Moreover. our team name in PUBG is 'Team Laboratory' (實驗室隊).

So, we 'established' 'LabXTalents' (實驗室嘅人才推廣計畫有限公司).
